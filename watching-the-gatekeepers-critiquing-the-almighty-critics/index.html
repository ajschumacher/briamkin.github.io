There are no shortage of articles and trolls on the internet that call out film critics for being a bit "snobby", over-the-top, or out of touch. Just look <a href="http://www.worldarchitecture.org/authors-links/cpncv/whats-wrong-with-current-film-critics.html">here</a> or <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/calling-out-film-critics/?_r=0">here</a> or <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/04/12/film-critics-wrong/">here</a> or.. okay you get the idea! A simple <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=film+critics+suck">google search</a> will reveal quite a lot of discontent with today's film critics. Are all these people just people who are upset because their favorite movies got bad reviews? We definitely have a lot of cry babies and internet trolls in society today: <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/cry-baby.jpg" alt="cry baby" />
One guy on <a href="http://www.cracked.com/funny-6303-movie-critics/">cracked.com</a> went as far as to describe a film critic like so:  </p>

<pre><code>Movie Critics are people who cannot create anything themselves, but still feel the need to be recognized by the creative community.  
</code></pre>

<p>And he goes on:  </p>

<pre><code>Movie critics are the not-so-distant real-world cousins of Internet trolls.  
</code></pre>

<p><b>Ouch</b>. That was harsh.  </p>

<h5 id="theproblemwheresthemath">The Problem: Where's the Math?</h5>

<p>So it's great to make wild outlandish claims with anecdotal evidence like this: <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/madblackwomanmovie.jpg" alt="Diary of a Mad Black Woman Rotten Tomatoes" />
That is a 71% difference! Critics on average absolutely hated this movies while nearly 100,000 audience members liked it! How can the critics be so wrong? How can they be so out of touch? This is ridiculous! Or is it just a outlier? <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/outlier.jpg" alt="outlier" /></p>

<h5 id="thequestionarefilmcriticsreallythatoutoftouch">The Question: Are film critics really that out of touch?</h5>

<p>Are film critics as bad as people say? Is there actual data that back up this assertion? Well, I thought I would find out...</p>

<h5 id="themethodhowshouldwedothis">The Method: How should we do this?</h5>

<p>In general what people have done to measure this in the past is simply looking at the averages and seeing how far apart they are. Like <a href="http://stephenfollows.com/do-film-critics-and-audiences-agree/">this</a>: <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/averagerating.png" alt="Average Rating" />
This seems to be a very common way, but it definitely has its issues. Film critics and regular audience members could simply just have very different internal scales in how they grade movies. But maybe film critics and audience members generally believe good movies are good and bad movies are bad and actually agree for the most part. Here is an example: </p>

<p>One critic rates movies he hates at around 10% and movies he like at around 70% while movies he absolutely loves are 90%+. One audience member who frequents <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> or <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> rates movies he hates at around 50%, movies he likes at around 90% and movies he loves at 100%. And let's say that they have the <b>exact same</b> taste in movies.</p>

<p>If we just measured averages, we would say that the critic is much <b>harsher</b> than the audience member. <b>BUT</b> that would be very far from the truth because they actually have similar tastes. If only there was a statistical method to measure correlation....</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/rsquared.jpg" alt="R Squared" /></p>

<p>Gotta love statistics! We will be using the R  squared or "The Coefficient of Determination" to figure out if they are in fact "correlated" (actually using R^2 Adjusted to account for different sample sizes). So measuring this is very different than comparing averages. In other words, we will be measuring how critics and audience members <b>change together</b>. I know this is technically not what our formula is calculating, but close enough!</p>

<h5 id="strikestealingstrikecollectingthedata"><strike>Stealing</strike>  Collecting the Data</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/stealing_data.jpg" alt="Stealing Data" />
So for this project, I <a href="http://briank.im/tag/scraping/">scraped</a> (using <a href="http://briank.im/scraping">beautiful soup</a>) <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> to get information about each film critic. Basically I stole all the critic information off of the Metacritic website (slowly enough so that they wouldn't blacklist me) and put it into a giant database so I could analyze it. I collected all critics' reviews, scores for the movie and the corresponding <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores">metascores</a> and audience member review averages for each movie (If you're interested in the actual math/coding that I did, you can see it <a href="https://github.com/briamkin/best_critic">here</a>). </p>

<h5 id="analyzingthedata">Analyzing the Data</h5>

<p>Like any major dataset, there was a lot of "cleaning" that I had to do because much of it was incomplete. But when all was said and done, about 300 critics (out of 600) qualified to be used in this analysis (at least 50 eligible reviews with corresponding audience member reviews and metascores). Now all that's left to do is to calculate how correlated each critic is with the average audience member.</p>

<h5 id="overallpicture">Overall Picture</h5>

<p>So to give an overall picture first: <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/overall_dist.jpg" alt="Distribution of Correlation" />
From this we see that there's a pretty wide distribution of correlations amongst the 300+ critics with most in the 10% - 20% range. Now what do these percentages mean? Well if the correlation was 0% it would mean that there absolutely no mutual pattern between the critic and the average audience member. Whereas if it was 100% it would mean that they were perfectly aligned in their views across all movies. Now what does it mean that the average correlation is 16%? </p>

<p>It means that the internet troll are right! That's right! Sorry for feeding the trolls... <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/internettrolls.jpg" alt="internet trolls" /></p>

<p>But we can conclusively conclude (and redundantly) that film critics are completely out of tune with the average audience member! So let me give you an example of what a graph might look like for an out of tune film critic. <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/j_hoberman.jpg" alt="J Hoberman Distribution" />
So this is a scatter plot of film critic J. Hoberman's movie review score against the average audience member review for that same movie. You can see here that there is no clear pattern, hence the measly 3.8% correlation. Ironically enough, J. Hoberman was actually <a href="http://variety.com/2012/film/news/village-voice-lays-off-film-critic-j-hoberman-6369/">let go</a> a couple years ago by the Village Voice after 40 years of working there.</p>

<h5 id="thestrikedundiesstrikecriticawards">The <strike>Dundies</strike> Critic Awards</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/dundies.jpg" alt="Dundies" />
So using this data, I came up with a bunch of different measurements that seemed cool. So I really dug deep into my creativity reservoirs and decided to present them as "The Critic Awards".</p>

<h5 id="thepeoplescriticalonsoduralde">The People's Critic - Alonso Duralde</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/alsono_duralde_profile.jpg" alt="Alonso Duralde" />
This award goes to the critic with the <b>highest</b> correlation with the average audience member. So with a correlation of 44%, the winner is <a href="https://twitter.com/aduralde">Alonso Duralde</a> of The <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/">Wrap</a>. Congratulations Alonso, you deserved it! And hopefully you will read this and retweet it to your well-deserved 9,000 followers!</p>

<p>If you're wondering what a more highly correlated scatter plot looks like, here you go! <br />
<img src="../content/images/2015/04/Alonso_Duralde.jpg" alt="Alonso Duralde" /></p>

<h5 id="theantipeoplescriticmelissalevine">The Anti-People's Critic - Melissa Levine</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/anti-people.png" alt="anti people" />
This award goes to the critic who is the <b>LEAST</b> aligned with the average audience member! Congratulations Melissa Levine, formerly of the Dallas Observer! You somehow managed to have a 0.05% correlation!</p>

<h5 id="thepeoplespublicationtotalfilm">The People's Publication - Total Film</h5>

<p>This award goes to the publication that is most aligned with everyday folks like you and me. Congrats <a href="https://twitter.com/totalfilm">Total Film</a> with an average 42.4% correlation across 13 different critics!</p>

<h5 id="theantipeoplespublicationthedallasobserver">The Anti-People's Publication - The Dallas Observer</h5>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="https://twitter.com/dallas_observer">The Dallas Observer</a>, you are officially out of touch with the average audience member with only an 8% average correlation across 7 critics!</p>

<h5 id="theoptimisticcriticcalvinwilson">The Optimistic Critic - Calvin Wilson</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/optimistic.jpg" alt="thumbs up" />
This award goes to the critic who, on average, rates movies much more highly than the average audience member. Congratulations <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinwilsonstl">Calvin Wilson</a> of the [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://twitter.com/stltoday, you gave an average review that was 9.9% higher than the average!</p>

<h5 id="thesnobbiestcriticstevesimels">The Snobbiest Critic - Steve Simels</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/snobby.jpg" alt="snob" />
Congratulations Steve Simels, of <a href="https://twitter.com/tvguide">TV Guide</a>, you gave ratings that were on average, 24.3% lower than the average audience member! </p>

<h5 id="thecriticscriticjohnhartl">The Critic's Critic - John Hartl</h5>

<p>This award goes to the critic that is most closely aligned with the average critic! How well do a critic's reviews align with the metascore(weighted critics' average) for that movie. Congratulations <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/author/john-hartl/">Jon Hartl</a>, of the <a href="https://twitter.com/seattletimes">Seattle Times</a>, you were on average 78% aligned with the average critic!</p>

<h5 id="therenegadecriticphilhall">The Renegade Critic - Phil Hall</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/renegade.jpg" alt="Renegade" />
This goes to the critic who goes against the grain of his fellow critics! Congratulations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hall_(US_writer)">Phil Hall</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/filmthreat">Film Threat</a>! While you may have been misaligned with the average audience member, you were also completely misaligned with other critics! You really play your drum to another beat... you only had a 0.86% correlation with your fellow critic! </p>

<h5 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h5>

<p>And so this concludes the first round of <b>The Critic Awards</b>! I hope you enjoyed this article and realize that most film critics aren't really trustworthy in figuring out what movies you should watch!</p>

<h5 id="futurethoughts">Future Thoughts</h5>

<p>While I only had a little more than a week to do this project, I hope to be able to add more features in the future. I would love to create a system where a user rates 10 stock movies and then from that create a recommendation of film critics that they are most aligned with. And after that, creating a new film review system would be great, one that weighs average audience member reviews, film reviews, and a few other metrics (gross, budget, etc.) and is personalized based on your stock movie reviews.</p>
