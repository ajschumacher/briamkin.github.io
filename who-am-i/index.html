            <h5 id="noimnotgoingthroughaquarterlifecrisis">No I'm Not Going Through a Quarter Life Crisis!</h5>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/quarter-life-crisis.png" alt="Quarter Life Crisis" />
I don't think I'm going through a quarter life crisis... at least not yet and it's not because I'm too old for one (I'm planning on living well into my 120s...) But, this past year I've been thinking a lot about who I am. We had several speakers come to Metis in recent days talking about finding jobs. I definitely heard a lot of great advice, but one of the best was simply to know who you are and what you want. And as I've thought about what I want, I've thought again about what my <b>Core Values</b> are. What I mean by Core Values is more than what I think my strenghts are, but more about why I think I'm alive and what I was born to do. What are the things that make me feel alive? And these are values that I want to see not just in myself, but also in workplaces that I eventually apply to.</p>

<p>These are 4 core values that I hope to fully embody one day! I am nowhere near that point now, but it is definitely something to strive for! It also doesn't mean that these are my only core values, but ones that I highly value.</p>

<h5 id="corevalue1learnandideatealways">Core Value #1: Learn and Ideate Always</h5>

<p>I want to always be learning. I love learning and when I'm in places just doing the same monotonous things every day, I get really bored of it, quickly. I also love to ideate about anything. Being given the opportunity to consider creative solutions is incredibly exciting!</p>

<h5 id="corevalue2improveinefficientsystems">Core Value #2: Improve Inefficient Systems</h5>

<p>Watching people doing something inefficiently just makes me want to jump in and do it for them! If I watch someone on a computer right clicking and copying, and then right clicking to paste, I start to cringe... <br />

<h5 id="corevalue3befairjustandtransparent">Core Value #3: Be Fair, Just, and Transparent</h5>

<p>One of the things that I believe in is treating adults like adults. Maybe growing up in a confucian style culture where hierarchy means everything, I've strayed in the opposite direction. But whatever the reason, I think people should be respected, whether they are working under you, above you, or next to you. This might sound like a DUH, OBVIOUS statement, but definitely not the experience most of us have. It's also something that I think you have to intentionally strive to do to make it happen. </p>

<p>An important way to make sure this happens is by being transparent in your actions. Make sure people understand why you're doing something. Don't just tell people to listen to you because you're the boss. This also means giving everyone a voice and credit for their ideas. Some of the best ideas come from the most unexpected places.</p>

<p>This also includes my belief in meritocracy. People should be awarded based on their productivity. Just because you are a certain age, a certain demographic, or don't have a certain degree, it shouldn't mean that you don't get a fair chance.</p>

<h5 id="corevalue4raiseupleaders">Core Value #4: Raise Up Leaders</h5>

<p>This is something that I don't necessarily think I can do now in a large capacity, but something I want to continue to do (and to do better) as I get older and more experienced. Some of the most important things I've learned, not just about leadership, but about life, I've learned while being mentored and <b>also</b> while mentoring others. Mentoring others doesn't mean that you are necessarily that much smarter, wiser, more experienced than that person, but it means that you are invested in his or her life and well-being. You also end up learning way more than you think you will by playing that role in someone's life! I want to always have people in my life that I can call a mentor, and someone that I can call a mentee, whether it is a formal or informal relationship.</p>
